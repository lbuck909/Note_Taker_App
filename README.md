# Note Taker Application

## Overview
The note taker application allows users to create, save and delete notes at their leisure.

## The Challenge
I was tasked to create an application that uses Express.js to retrieve data from a JSON file. The aformentioned processes must deploy to Heroku successfully.

## Usage Instructions
* Upon opening the landing page, users can select GET STARTED.
* Existing notes will appear on the left hand side of the screen. 
* The right side will provide the user with an oppurtunity to create a new note title and write details underneath 
* Once the user is satisfied with their note of choice a SAVE icon can be selected at the top right side of the app. Notes must be saved to move to the shown task list in the left hand column.
